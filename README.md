# TNT Script used by Guoyi

The TNT script follows MIT and part of script is from setk.run belonging to Salvador Arias (Instituto Miguel Lillo, San Miguel de TucumÃ¡n, Argentina).

## Usage

- Place this script and your matrix tnt file `filename` under the folder that you call `tnt` or `exe` file is placed

- Enter `tnt`

- Enter command `guoyi filename;`

## Functions

- Estimate implied weighting K value.      

- Search trees via TBR Mult (1000 times) and Xmult (use random sectorial searches, produce 1,000 hits to best length and stop, 10 cycles of drifting, ratchet and fusing).      

- Perform Strict consensus.            

- Calculate Relative Bremer support, jackknifing (1,000 times), and bootstrap (1,000 times).

- Map apomorphic characters on the consensus tree.

- Calculate TL, CI, and RI. 

## Options

- Results instructions are at the end of `tnt.log`.

- `trees.tre`, `resample.tre` are trees with taxname.

- `trees_no.tre`, `resample_no.tre` are trees without taxname.

- `nelsen` can be replaced by `majority`.

- `xmult` and `mult` replications and hold trees number can be adjusted.

- `winclada.tre` can be transferred to the acceptable format for WinClada by tnt2winclada and the output file can be put into Winclada with your tnt matrix file `filename` for mapping apomorphic characters and homoplasy.
